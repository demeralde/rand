# rand

A simple CLI script for generating a random number between a given range.

## Usage

1. Install [Go](https://golang.org/)

2. Install the package:

```sh
go install github.com/dspacejs/rand
```

1. Run the script with a `min` and `max` number:

```sh
rand 1 3
```

It will print a random number between this range (e.g in this example, `1`, `2`, and `3` are the possible values).
